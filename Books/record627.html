<td valign="top" class="datatablecell_2_14" width="100%"><span class="fnp2539_rvts0">
"The idea that Holland's daughter was like the princess locked in the &nbsp;tower of a damp castle was of course false. After all, she was living on a &nbsp;property in western New South Wales." &nbsp;<br/>
Once upon a time, on a property in western New South Wales, a man named &nbsp;Holland plants hundreds of varieties of eucalyptus trees, then decrees that &nbsp;only the suitor who can name each and every one of them will be worthy to &nbsp;marry his beautiful daughter, Ellen. Men try and fail: there is the gentle &nbsp;schoolteacher who "had correctly named eighty-seven eucalypts and was doing &nbsp;it well when he went blank at the fatly handsome Jarrah up against the &nbsp;fence behind the house"; and the New Zealander who "came up against, and &nbsp;was defeated by, one of the many Stringybarks..." Old men, young men, &nbsp;commercial travelers, sheep-shearers--even a "smiling Chinaman ... all &nbsp;the way from Darwin." Not one is successful. Then, one day, along comes Mr. &nbsp;Roy Cave, a man renowned in the eucalyptus world, someone who "employed &nbsp;with lip-smacking relish the terms 'petiole,' 'inflorescences,' 'falacte' &nbsp;and 'lanceolate,' and he was also comfortable with 'sessile', 'fusiform' &nbsp;and 'conculorous.'" &nbsp;<br/>
 &nbsp;Even in so wonderfully fractured a fairy tale as Murray Bail's &nbsp;Eucalyptus, it's obvious that Roy Cave is hardly the stuff romantic &nbsp;dreams are made of. Indeed, despite her father's warning to "beware of any &nbsp;man who deliberately tells a story," Ellen's Prince Charming turns out to &nbsp;be a mysterious young stranger who finds her wandering among her father's &nbsp;trees and spins her tale after tale, each one tied to a different kind of &nbsp;eucalypt. As the weeks go by, Mr. Cave continues to successfully identify &nbsp;every tree on the property, thus drawing ever closer to his prize. &nbsp;Meanwhile, Ellen's other suitor captures first her imagination and &nbsp;then her heart with stories of apprentice hairdressers who fall in love &nbsp;with plain-Jane heiresses; solicitors' daughters involved with married men; &nbsp;and lonely canary breeders who almost find happiness with spinster piano &nbsp;teachers. What all of these off-kilter stories have in common is a theme of &nbsp;missed opportunities, and lovers who realize too late that they were made for &nbsp;each other. Will Ellen, too, end up like one of these the sad-hearted &nbsp;heroines, or will her would-be lover find a way to thwart Mr. Cave's &nbsp;relentless victory march through the Eucalypts to claim her hand? &nbsp; <br/>
 &nbsp;There is so much to love about Bail's novel that it's difficult to identify &nbsp;exactly which of its qualities make it such a complete delight. Is it &nbsp;Ellen's "speckled beauty ... so covered in small brown-black moles she &nbsp;attracted men, every sort of man"? Is it the detailed descriptions of the &nbsp;landscape? The way Bail uses them to comment on human nature, on the nature &nbsp;of storytelling and of language itself ("a paragraph is not so different &nbsp;from a paddock--similar shape, similar function")? Or is it the wacky charm of &nbsp;the Scheharezade-like suitor's urban tales? ("Still in the vicinity of &nbsp;low-height eucalypts he went on to mention, in a thoughtful voice, how in &nbsp;an outer suburb of Hobart an actuary with a well-known insurance company &nbsp;needed a stepladder to woo a widow who passed by his house every day.") &nbsp; Whatever the source of Bail's peculiar magic, Eucalyptus casts a &nbsp;spell that will carry readers from first page to last and leave them &nbsp;wishing for a thousand and one more stories just like it. --Alix Wilber.<br/>
