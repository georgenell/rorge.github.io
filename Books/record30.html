An excerpt from the Mt Algidus story by Sally Nell&lt;blockquote&gt;We arrived in the spring of 1985 with Charles, eight weeks old, Victoria, two years, George, five years, and Lucy, six and a half years old. &nbsp;The snowdrops were out around Mona Anderson's house. &nbsp;Every spring we were there I looked forward to seeing the snowdrops, that meant we were on the way to summer. &nbsp;Though that also meant floods.<br/>
<br/>
Springtime was also shearing time. &nbsp;We had decided to continue with blade shearing that first spring, as Chris Richards had done before us. &nbsp;Graham was to class the wool himself and we were aware of costs so I got to be shearers' cook, which was my job for all the time we were at Algidus. &nbsp;I always had help, though some better than others.<br/>
<br/>
In 1985 it was Angela Milne who was employed to teach Lucy and George their correspondence school work and to help me as needed. &nbsp;We shore for fifteen days straight that first spring. &nbsp;The routine was get up, cook and wash dishes. &nbsp;If we got a load of nappies on the line that was a plus. &nbsp;We fell into bed at the end of the day!<br/>
<br/>
Usually, before the men came to the house for tea, we managed a quick gin and tonic. &nbsp;That's if the food was all prepared. &nbsp;Angela was once going to write about her adventures at Algidus and call it 'Gin and Cabbages'. &nbsp;We must have had a lot of cabbages that year! &nbsp;Angela now lives in London and still talks of gin and cabbages and what fun it was.<br/>
<br/>
With shearers, farm staff and family, we had at times twenty-plus to feed. &nbsp;Most of the time I believe they had enough and went away full. &nbsp;We planned a BBQ one night, after days of sun, only to pick the first day of rain! &nbsp;The men still cooked the chops just under the veranda. &nbsp;Another time I cooked a roast with a tea towel stuck to the bottom of it. &nbsp;The tea towel must have stuck to the frozen meat when I was transferring it into the roasting pan. &nbsp;The meat was still well cooked so I didn't tell the men about that one!<br/>
<br/>
The shearers were always great audiences for the children's plays and concerts and we had a lot of parties. &nbsp;One year we even had a budding poet whi spent many days writing a poem for us, about Algidus.<br/>
<br/>
Because the shearing shed could be seen from the house, I had a few minutes for last minute panics as the men walked up. &nbsp;Like the time the pie top didn't cook, so I turned the grill up high, removed the uncooked pastry, stuffed the food processor with bread and left over toasties and scones from morning smoko, gave it a quick whiz and covered the pie. &nbsp;Back in the oven for a quick grill and lunch was ready!&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>
