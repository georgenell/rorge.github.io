At the opening of Sir Winston's third volume we see William of Orange as King of England - jointly regnant with his Stuart wife. &nbsp;This, the prime result of the Revolution of 1688, made England's greatest enemy, no longer Spain but, as had been the case so many centuries before, the great power facing us across the Channel. &nbsp;William III gave the French Ambassador twenty-four hours in which to leave the kingdom and so, with firm purpose, determined upon war with France - war which was to continue in one form or another with periods of uneasy peace until the time came when Wellington watched the Old Guard broken and saw Napoleon, huddled in his coach, drive away from the field of Waterloo and from the theatre of history.<br/>
<br/>
The hundred-and-twenty-five years covered by this voume are among the richest in modern history. &nbsp;They are filled with great captains - Sir Winston's own illustrious forebear Marlborough, Wolfe, Clive, Nelson and Wellington; with great statesmen - Walpole, Chatham and Pitt; with great writers, philosophers and scientists. &nbsp;Huge territories changed hands as the British Empire was forged in the heat of the continuing struggle. &nbsp;Vast areas, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, were brought for the first time beneath the hand of man. &nbsp;New lands were settled, and new countries born.<br/>
<br/>
First among those new countries stands that which grew from the one defeat sustained by Britain during this age of splendour; the United States of America. &nbsp;From the first meeting of the congress of delegates in May 1775, from the bitter war and the eventual Declaration of Independance sprang the great Power of today. &nbsp;With that Declaration, and with the discoveries made by such intrepid seamen as Cook in the Southern Hemisphere, Sir Winston has reached the full extent of his canvas. &nbsp;By the end of this magnificent volume all the English-Speaking Peoples who today, whatever their conditions or origins, stand so united, have taken their place in the unfolding pageant.<br/>
