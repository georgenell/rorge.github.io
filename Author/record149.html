In the second volume of his great work Sir Winston sails forth into broader waters. &nbsp;As he says, 'Far-reaching events took place in the two centuries covered by this volume. &nbsp;The New World of the American continent was discovered and settled by European adventure. &nbsp;In the realms of speculation and belief, poetry and art, other new worlds were opened to the human spirit. &nbsp;Between 1485 and 1688 the English people began to spread out over all the globe.' &nbsp;The king who had died at Bosworth had no conception of the endless vistas stretching ahead to the generation which, in 1688, saw their king slip down the Thames into exile. &nbsp;These two turbulent, yet fecund, centuries were the years which saw the Golden Age - known by the name of the first Queen Elizabeth, though its foundations were laid by her forbears - and the begining of the world's greatest empire; then the seventeenth century, the century of internal strife in which the English Parliament developed from an advisory to a governing body, arbiter of the highest affairs of State. &nbsp;These were the years which saw, too, the development of the British lands upon the North American continent which widened beyond measure the outlook and the standing of this country. &nbsp;And through these lands, huddled along a stretch of coast, were but the germ of what has become so great a country, they nurtured upon their soil seeds which are bearing thier fullest fruit today. &nbsp;Truly the two centures covered by this book are amongst the most exciting and the most expansive in the history of the Western World. &nbsp;And there is not a moment, nor a turn of history, which is not relished, savoured and described with superb judgement, by Sir Winston Churchill.<br/>
