&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;"If you were to rush into this room right now and announce that you had struck a deal - with God, Allah, Buddah, Christ, Krishna, Bill Gates, whomever - in which the ten years since my diagnosis could be magically taken away, traded in for ten more years as the person I was before, I would, without a moment's hesitation, tell you to take a hike."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In September 1998, Michale J. Fox stunned the world by announcing that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease - a degenerative neurological condition. &nbsp;In fact, he has been secretly fighting it for seven years. &nbsp;The worldwide response was staggering. &nbsp;Fortunatly, he had accepted the diagnosis, and by the time the public started grieving for him, he had stopped grieving for himself. &nbsp;Now, with the same passion, humour, and energy that he has invested in his dozens of performances over the past eighteen years, he tells the story of his life, his career, and his campaign to find a cure for Parkinson's.<br/>
<br/>
Combining his trademark ironic sensibility and keen sense of the absurd, Fox recounts his life, from childhood in western Canada to the meteoric rise in film and television that made him a worldwide celebrity. &nbsp;Most important, however, he writes of the past ten years, during which - with the unswerving support of his wife, family and friends - he has dealt with illness. &nbsp;He talks about what Parkinson's has given him: the chance to appreciate a wonderful life and career, and the opportunity to help search for a cure and spread public awareness of the disease. &nbsp;He feels as if he is a very lucky man, indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Michael J. Fox began his career as the lovable Alex P. Keaton, the star of the popular sitcom &lt;i&gt;Family Ties&lt;/i&gt;. &nbsp;Since then, his career has been a nonstop success story, with blockbuster movies like &lt;i&gt;Back to the Future, The Secret of My Success, Doc Hollywood&lt;/i&gt; and the lead voice in &lt;i&gt;Stuart Little&lt;/i&gt; and Disney's &lt;i&gt;Atlantis: The Lost Empire&lt;/i&gt;. &nbsp;He retired recently from his award winning role on &lt;i&gt;Spin City&lt;/i&gt;. &nbsp;Michael has won numerous awards, including four Golden Globes, four Emmys, two Screen Actors Guild awards, GQ Man of the Year, and the People's Choice award.<br/>
