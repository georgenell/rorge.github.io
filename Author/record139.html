&lt;i&gt;An Unfinished Life&lt;/i&gt; is the first authoritative single-volume life of John F. Kennedy to be written in nearly four decades. &nbsp;Drawing upon firsthand sources, freshly unearthed documents, and never-before-opened archives, prizewinning historian Robert Dallek reveals more than we ever knew about Jack Kennedy, forever changing the way we think about his life, his presidency, and his legacy.<br/>
<br/>
In a tale that stretches back to Ireland, &lt;i&gt;An Unfinished Life&lt;/i&gt; describes the birth of the Kennedy dynasty, the complexity of Jack's early years, and the mixture of adulation and resentment that tangled his relationships with his mother, Rose, and his father, Joseph. &nbsp;Forced into the shadow of his older brother, Joe, Jack struggled to find a place for himself until World War II, when he became a national hero and launched his career. &nbsp;Dallek reveals for the first time the full story of Kennedy's wartime actions - including the machinations that got him into the war despite severe disabilities - and the true details of how Joe was killed, opening the door to Jack's ascendancy.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the gripping story of Jack's first political campaigns and his transformation from an awkward speaker to a brilliant politician with irresistable charm. &nbsp;&lt;i&gt;An Unfinished Life&lt;/i&gt; explores Jack's work as a senator for Massachusetts, carries us through the fiercely contested 1960 campaign against Nixon, and takes us on to the White House iteself. &nbsp;We learn for the first time how and why Bobby was chosen to serve as attorney general, how JFK selected Lyndon Johnson to be vice president, and how they and the rest of Kennedy's team - Bundy, McNamara, Schlesinger, Sorensen, Rust, and others - faced the Bay of Pigs, threats against civil rights activists in the South, the conflict in Laos, the Cuban missile crisis, the struggle for a test ban treaty, and the assassination of Diem. &nbsp;Dallek reveals fascinating new details about each of these challenges and many more, and gives us a picture of Kennedy as a man very much in command of his times - able, soon after arriving in the Oval Office, to wage a secret war against his own generals when they advocated first use of atomic bombs in situations Kennedy felt certian would lead to all-out nuclear war.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;i&gt;An Unfinished Life&lt;/i&gt; also discloses for the very first time that Kennedy was far sicker than we ever knew. &nbsp;While laboring to present an image of robust good health, Kennedy was secretly in and out of hospitals throughout his life, so ill that he was administered last rites on several occasions. &nbsp;Kennedy's every-worsening health left him propped up by a secret combination of medications throught his presidency, while behind closed doors he required assistance for even such basic acts as climbing stairs. &nbsp;The revelations about Kennedy's health throughout this biography force a complete reevaluation of Kennedy's reputation and provide a fuller look inside his life and his motivations than has ever before been possible.<br/>
<br/>
Robert Dallek has created a vivid portrait of a man who, because he knew how close he was to death, lived as much as he could - sometimes hurting others in the process. &nbsp;We meet a young Jackie, follow their courtship, and watch their marriage in public and private. &nbsp;Dallek explores Kennedy's many infidelities, revealing some for the first time ever. &nbsp;&lt;i&gt;An Unfinished Life&lt;/i&gt; also gives us a brilliantly detailed portrait of the deep bond between Jack and Bobby, and of their enduringly complicated relationship with their father.<br/>
<br/>
Never shying away from Kennedy's weakness, Dallek also brilliantly explores his strengths. &nbsp;The result is a full portrait of a bold, brave, human Kennedy, once again a hero. &nbsp;&lt;i&gt;An Unfinished Life&lt;/i&gt; is the book Americans have been waiting forty years to read. &nbsp;Now, at long last, we have the definitive biography of Jack Kennedy.<br/>
