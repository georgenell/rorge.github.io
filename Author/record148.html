The English-speaking peoples comprise the greatest number of human beings sharing a common language in the world today - or prehaps at any time in history. &nbsp;These people share not only a common language, but also a common heritage; with small local differences they share also a common way of life, a common idea of the decencies and the liberties to which man is entitled. &nbsp;It is a proud thought that this great bond between men who live as far removed from one another as Australia, the U.S.A. and Canada, Scotland, and South Africa, has been made, and made fast, by the influence and the initiative of the inhabitants of the British Isles. &nbsp;Those inhabitants are themselves an alloy cast by time from many elements - the Scots, the Irish, the Welsh, the English - and the last named, who made the language which has gone round the world, are themselves a mixture of Celt, Roman, Angle, Saxon, Dane and Norman.<br/>
<br/>
For his new work, which is to be completed in four volumes, Sir Winston Churchill has taken as his subject this great element in world history: The English-Speaking Peoples. &nbsp;Volume I tells the story of our island from pre-history to the Battle of Bosworth; it describes the strife and turmoil inevitable in the making of a nation. &nbsp;When this volume begins, tribal law was supreme; when it ends, Britain had become a nation and stood on the threshold of those adventures overseas which were to make an empire and to give mankind a lingua franca.<br/>
<br/>
The statesman who has given so much of his life to the service of these islands rejoices in telling their story. &nbsp;As always, Sir Winston is both wise and witty; a single phrase which may make the reader laugh will be seen on examination to strike to the heart of an historical problem. &nbsp;Historians who have seen the proofs of this book have said that for the first time the convolutions of the Wars of the Roses have become clear to them. &nbsp;If a potential buyer of these volumes were to ask one question: Why must they beyond any doubt find a place on my shelves? - it can be answered shortly. &nbsp;There has never been a history like this written by a man who has himself made history; never have the political and diplomatic decisions of the past been considered by a writer who, all his life, has had to make decisions of the same character and of the same magnitude. &nbsp;That alone must make this history unique.<br/>
